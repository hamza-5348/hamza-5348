Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hamza Hassan, a software magician specializing in full-stack JavaScript, conjuring wonders with Node.js and React.js. Self-taught and unstoppable, I'm always hungry for new tech and life adventures. From crafting sleek static websites to diving deep into the backend, I'm all about attention to detail and creating the coolest products.

Here's my spellbook of languages and tools:
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- React.js
- MongoDB
- Postgresql
- Git
- GitHub
- VS Code
- HTML5
- CSS3
-  and more!

Catch me deploying on GCP, AWS, Azure using GitHub Actions and other CI/CDs.  

Currently brewing up spells with GitHub Actions, JSON Web Tokens, and Material-UI. 

Let's create some magic together! âœ¨
